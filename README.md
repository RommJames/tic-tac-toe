# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a simple yet powerful web app game that reimagines the classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience! This project is built with a focus on modularity, code reusability, and minimal global state. Through the clever use of **Factory Functions**, **Closures**, and the **Module Pattern**, this implementation offers a clean, scalable architecture while maintaining the spirit of the traditional game.

## Key Features:
- **Modular Design**: The game logic is split into manageable, self-contained modules.
- **Factory Functions**: Game pieces, player behavior, and game states are encapsulated in factory functions that provide flexibility and reusability.
- **Closure**: Private data, such as the game board and current player, is encapsulated within closures, ensuring that each game instance remains isolated and independent.
- **Minimal Global State**: Global variables are kept to a minimum, reducing potential side effects and making the app more maintainable.

## Why this project?
This game serves as a practice ground for mastering JavaScript design patterns like Factory Functions, Closures, and the Module Pattern. By focusing on creating a compact, efficient, and modular application, you'll learn how to build clean, organized code without unnecessary global dependencies.
